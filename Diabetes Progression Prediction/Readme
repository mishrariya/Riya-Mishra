## Diabetes Progression Prediction
This file contains code that performs linear regression for predicting for predicting diabetes progression based on input features. The dataset used in this project includes training and testing data, and the goal is to train a Linear Regression model to predict diabetes progression and evaluate its performance.

# Introduction
Linear regression is a commonly used machine learning algorithm for regression tasks. In this project, we utilize the Scikit-learn library to implement a Linear Regression model for predicting diabetes progression based on input features. The dataset includes both training and testing data, allowing us to train the model on one subset and evaluate its performance on another.

# Model
A Linear Regression model is employed to predict diabetes progression based on the input features. The input features are used to predict the target variable in a linear relationship.

# Results
The R-squared score is calculated using the true target values from the training data and the predicted values from the model. This score indicates the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is predictable from the input features. The higher the R-squared score, the better the model's fit to the training data.
